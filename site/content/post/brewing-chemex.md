Node.js is a popular open-source, server-side JavaScript runtime environment built on the Chrome V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to use JavaScript to write command-line tools, server-side scripting, and event-driven server-side applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight, efficient, and perfect for building scalable and high-performance applications.

Node.js has a vast ecosystem of modules and packages that can be easily installed using the Node Package Manager (npm). It is widely used for building web applications, APIs, real-time chat applications, and more. It has gained significant popularity in recent years due to its ability to handle large amounts of data and its ease of use for developers who are already familiar with JavaScript.

Node.js has become an essential tool for modern web development, and it is used by many major companies such as Netflix, LinkedIn, and Uber. Its popularity and community support ensure that it will remain a relevant technology for the foreseeable future.

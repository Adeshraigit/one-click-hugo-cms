Front-end development refers to the development of the client-side of web applications that users interact with directly. It involves creating and designing the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of web applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of front-end development is to create a visually appealing and responsive website or application that is user-friendly and easy to navigate.

Front-end developers work on the visual aspects of web applications, including layout, design, and user interaction. They use HTML to structure web pages, CSS to style them, and JavaScript to add interactivity and functionality to web applications.

Front-end development is essential to ensure that a website or application is optimized for user experience, accessibility, and performance. It requires a good understanding of web technologies, design principles, and user experience. Front-end developers often work closely with back-end developers who focus on server-side logic and database management to create a fully functional web application.

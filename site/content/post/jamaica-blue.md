3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, is a process of creating three-dimensional objects from a digital design file. It involves building the object layer by layer, using a range of materials including plastic, metal, and even biological materials like living cells.

The 3D printing process starts with creating a digital 3D model using computer-aided design (CAD) software or scanning an existing object. The model is then sliced into thin layers, and the 3D printer builds the object layer by layer, following the design specifications.

3D printing has revolutionized manufacturing, enabling faster prototyping and production of complex designs, as well as reducing waste and costs. It has a wide range of applications, from creating small objects like toys and jewelry to building complex parts for airplanes and medical implants.

Advancements in 3D printing technology have made it more accessible and affordable, allowing individuals, small businesses, and even hobbyists to experiment with the technology and bring their ideas to life.
